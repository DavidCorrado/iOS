# iOS

iOS example using best practices

* Swift Package Manager over Pods
* Mint for command line tools such as SwiftLint
* Swift UI

TODO
* Review if should use mint with SwiftFormat
* Review Database libraries again
* Code Coverage Report
* Unit tests
* Swift Gen
* Fastlane
* Github action vs Xcode Server
* Document Xcode version needed
* Dark Mode
* Rxswift vs Combine
* Async/Await vs...

## Auto Format
brew install --cask swiftformat-for-xcode
Open Applications/SwiftFormat
Follow instructions in application
* I recommend also setting a key binding for formatting
